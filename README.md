"# Socketio-Chat-App-with-Python-Flask" 
In this project I was creating a miniatur chat app using python flask and sockio.
Socket.IO is a powerful JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between web clients and servers. It's designed to work on every platform, browser, or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed.

The application works by using web sockets to connect the front-en (html templates) with the back-end (flask-server).
